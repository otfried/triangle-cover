This script verifies that "most" triangles that fit into the unit
square also fit into the triangle with angles 45, 60, and 75 degrees
and longest edge of length sqrt(2).

## Requirements

This Python3 script requires the `pyhull` and `numpy` packages, which
can be installed with `pip`.

## Running

Run the script as
```
python3 square.py
```
The output is written to the Ipe-file `square.ipe`.
